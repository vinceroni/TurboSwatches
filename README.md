# TurboSwatches
_Intended as a collaborative project aimed at identifying the color palettes for TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine artwork._

__Please create an issue to collaborate.__

This is a source project for:
https://github.com/vinceroni/TG16-PCE-US-Box-Templates

The difficulty is that: We don't have any original design files, the print process results in a range of color variation, the colors begin to fade immediately, and lighting curcumstances during photography or scanning add an additional variable.

We're using Pantone as a primary control, P Solid Coated. Though, this project is only currently in an RGB file, until such time as someone actually does a print test.
This color book seems close enough. I'm reasonably happy with the colors, but I have a suspicion that they might have been using a different book, something with those brighter neon colors.
